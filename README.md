The VTMUNC website is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, which serves as the core infrastructure for the web application. This EC2 instance also functions as a reverse proxy, efficiently managing incoming traffic to ensure smooth and secure operations. Additionally, the server interacts with AWS DynamoDB, providing scalable and rapid access to the database for handling data-related tasks.
