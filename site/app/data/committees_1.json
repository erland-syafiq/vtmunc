                "committee_bio": "The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the primary intergovernmental body dedicated to promoting gender equality and women’s rights. The functional commission was established as part of the Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) in 1946 to address growing concerns about the United Nations’ ability to focus on gender equality. In March 2024, the 68th session of the commission will take place addressing how women in marginalized groups can achieve economic empowerment in the 21st century. \nFor the purposes of this committee, the first topic addresses how to economically empower women in rural areas. Rural women are often the most economically disenfranchised and overlooked groups in their country. Delegates will have to grapple with how to create policies that enhance rural women’s access to social, legal, and economic services as well as how they can utilize leadership opportunities, entrepreneurship, and community participation to bolster their economic status. The second topic focuses on migrant women, another marginalized group facing increasingly difficult economic barriers. Migrant women often go under-compensated for their work because of a lack of immigration status or uncompensated homework. The third topic will focus on providing resources to eradicate maternal mortality, an issue prevalent among women in poverty. Maternal mortality, an issue found particularly in developing countries, is a pressing concern as the alarming rates of maternal deaths during pregnancy continue to rise due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Delegates are tasked with the responsibility of creating methods that will ensure quality access to universal maternal healthcare with the common goal of reducing maternal mortality rates. The UN possesses the ability to bring countries together to collaborate to uplift women economically when they are either forced or make the brave decision to leave their home country. This committee gives delegates the special opportunity to discuss critical issues regarding the equity and economic empowerment of marginalized women across the globe.",

I’m currently a senior at Virginia Tech double majoring in economics and international relations with minors in French and data science. I’ve been involved in MUN since my sophomore year of college and am currently my team’s GA training chair. I’ve always loved GA’s ability to have young people consider intricate solutions to real-world problems, and I feel like it’s not something that happens in many other settings. Prior to college I did a lot of debate and speech in high school with NSDA and loved it. Apart from MUN, I am also co-president and founder of VT’s chapter of Amnesty International, so I always enjoy talking about issues of equity and policy improvements! In my free time, I love reading, journaling, watching Netflix shows, doing henna, and making Spotify playlists (especially if they involve Beyoncé). I am thrilled to have been able to create a committee I feel so passionate about, and I look forward to seeing you all there!\r\n",

                "committee_bio": "The World Health Organization (WHO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, was\r\nestablished in 1948 in order to further international public health efforts. As the World Health Organization expanded over time, it has become an entity that is able to guide, make recommendations, pursue research, establish health campaigns, and more to promote the better health of our global society, with primary focuses on achieving universal health coverage, preparing and responding to health emergencies, and addressing overall health and well-being. In this committee, delegates must face various issues and provide resolutions to the growing problems within our society that serve as a blockade to our better health.The first issue that seeks for response from our delegations is combatting rabies, especially in areas of poverty. Rabies, although possessing an effective vaccine, is a fatal disease that can be spread to people and pets if an infected animal bites or scratches them. In most countries around the world, especially developing countries, the death rate by rabies reaches to almost 59,000 and without proper systems in place, that rate may increase without immediate medical help or support. Secondly, delegates will be asked to demonstrate diplomacy and an effort to control organ trafficking. Organ trafficking, a longstanding heinous act that occurs worldwide, is extremely targeted towards higher-risk people (homeless, lower-income individuals, etc.). Therefore, a solution to stop traffickers and prevent the profit-oriented, inhumane industry. Lastly, delegates are then tasked with the global crisis against antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance, also known as antibiotic resistance or AMR, occurs when an increase in antimicrobial resistance is driven by a combination of germs exposed to antibiotics and the spread of those germs and their resistance mechanisms. This increases the risk of medical operations such as chemotherapy, organ transplants, and diabetes management. However, the effects of this issue have extended to veterinary, agricultural, and tourism industries as well, making it a crisis for countries across the globe. Altogether, WHO will encompass in-depth discussions in terms of approaching these very complex issues that will further promote justice around the world, because of how it tackles the injustices and major issues regarding health. \r\n\r\n",

The UNDP helps countries create and implement developmental policies, leadership skills, institutional capabilities and more. The UNDP focuses on three specific areas: sustainable development, democratic governance and peace building and finally climate and disaster resilience. \n\nAs a body of the United Nations, the first topic questions how to improve the economic stability in the Middle East, as there are glaring discrepancies in wealth across several states and within regions of those states. The second topic will promote discussion within the committee to debate methods to construct a balance in income across all genders. Within the Middle East, there is a large gap between the annual income earned by women when compared to the income earned by men. The committee aims to examine and create solutions to alleviate poverty for marginalized communities by creating and promoting access to a plethora of resources such as education and legal services. The final topic discusses potential methods for upholding these solutions and services created within the Middle East. Delegates will discuss methods to maintain and sustain solutions to prevent implemented systems from failing. In addition, delegates will confer about principles which will heighten access to the resources for these systems across the entire region to enhance social, gender-based, and economic growth in the Middle East. \n\nThis committee will allow delegates the opportunity to discuss and create methods of developmental growth and opportunity in the Middle East, as well as promote equal, accessible opportunities for anyone who needs them.

With the hero of Olympus, Percy Jackson, having mysteriously disappeared without a trace, the Greek demigods of Camp Half-Blood and their friends have become worried about his whereabouts. However, it seems that the gods don’t leave any time for concern, because Rachel Elizabeth Dare, the oracle of Delphi has arrived with a new prophecy from Mount Olympus for the demigods of Camp Halfblood to fulfill. Chiron, the acting camp director, has taken great lengths to keep the prophecy secret from anyone not directly called on by the prophecy (Something about the prophecy hitting too close to home? ) and has now gathered a group of campers to partake in this quest. What is the prophecy hiding? Is the safety of the world at stake again? Will more campers have to put their lives on the line to satisfy the disagreements of the deities? And perhaps most importantly, what happened to Percy Jackson?\r\n\r\nBalancing the political problems of Ancient Greece and the environment that is modern day New York, delegates will take on the roles of Greek demigods at Camp Half-Blood, and they shall be put to trials to balance the responsibilities of their Godly parenthood, their own goals, and perhaps most importantly, the fate of the future.",

Stereotypical Barbie, after going through a journey of self-discovery, decided to go into the human realm to learn more about what they have to offer and see how far she can push herself. On Earth, she decides to go by Margot and attempts to start fresh, without the expectations of her former life in Barbieland. Although the transition was very difficult at first, Margot was determined to make women feel empowered and make a difference in society. After spending five years in the “real world” with brief stints as an astrophysicist, Congresswoman, UNICEF ambassador, and marine biologist, she gets an alarming message from Weird Barbie that Barbieland is in some kind of trouble. The message was vague yet urgent and requested Margot to return to Barbie Land as soon as she could. After reading this message, Margot feels anxious that Barbie Land is in trouble but knows that she is willing to do whatever it takes to help the place she calls home. As she prepares to come home, we urge all of you to prepare for the looming crisis ahead. Will it be kenough to save Barbie land?",

As an International Relations major I have some super cool yet admittedly insane goals. If it was up to me I would 100% be the “leader of the universe.” However, I have accepted my mortal fate and will hopefully be working for an NGO or the Government in the near future. To be honest, I think a lot of other job paths are cooler but I’ve come into acceptance. While chairing this committee I really hope to use my position of leadership to inspire the delegates and help them bloom. To me the most important things in the world are acceptance and understanding, so come as you are to Barbieland, all are welcome..even Kens. On the topic of Barbie, my favorite part of the movie is totally when the Kens take over Barbieland, specifically when Barbie tells Ken she'll be his “short term, long distance girlfriend.” Oh boy I could relate with that one. I am so very excited to meet you all and I am already so proud. Sublime!",

I have participated in MUN throughout my time at Virginia Tech, and I am so happy to be coming back to chair this committee! Personally, I work as a Research Technician at MIT, but I always love to discuss complex politically and culturally relevant issues. I am a big tea and coffee enthusiast who loves to hike, walk, and do my daily sudoku puzzles! I am so excited to bring a competitive and engaging committee this year that is interesting for everyone and make VTMUNC I Ad hoc a fantastic experience!",

Aside from MUN, I love reading (I have an instagram account dedicated to books that has nine-hundred followers,) dog-sitting (even though they use my roommates room as a bathroom,) spending time with my friends, and doing puzzles (I think it might be an addiction.) I am also a proud NYT game enthusiast! I am looking forward to meeting everyone and bringing our ad-hoc idea to life!",
