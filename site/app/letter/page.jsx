                    <i>To the Esteemed Delegates, Faculty, and Friends of VTMUNC II,</i> <br/> <br/>
                    On behalf of Virginia Tech’s Model United Nations Conference’s Secretariat, staff, and the faculty that support us, it is with great pleasure that I invite you to our second annual conference at Virginia Tech’s Blacksburg Campus. The Secretariat and I are excited to invite you to our conference that will be held on February 28th, 2025 and continue to March 2nd, 2025.
                    <br/> <br/> After successful beginnings, the Virginia Tech Model United Nations Conference (VTMUNC) returns for its second iteration. With the motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), we are diligently working on our conference to continue serving you an equal and equitable experience of building skills in diplomacy, honesty, integrity, and resolution. These skills, integral to the Model United Nations experience, help students voice their opinions and truly become more world-minded as they solve our world’s most pressing issues. Even more so, Model United Nations helps you identify your enemies but even more so, your allies. At Virginia Tech, our delegation believes a leader must have the power to stand up for what is right alongside their allies but also by addressing their enemies respectfully. Those that stand by you in your fight for justice allow you to aspire for more change and reach for greater heights.
                    <br/> <br/> The theme for our conference heavily focuses on the idea to reach for greater heights, asking that you <b>“Reach for the Stars.”</b> In this day and age, we must aspire to fix conflict, no matter how creative and impossible it may seem. During VTMUNC, delegates will be asked to reach for the stars in order to resolve the pressing global issues by aiming higher and thinking bigger to encourage innovative thinking, bold leadership, and unprecedented collaboration. This conference is a call to action for all delegates to transcend conventional boundaries, harness their unique talents, and drive transformative change by aiming for the stars.
                    <br/> <br/> We are thrilled to announce that this marks that registration for our conference is open and ready for our delegations. We have enacted new policies for this conference regarding refunds, registration, and fees. Please continue to visit our website and our instagram page @vtmunc for more information. If you have any questions, contact vtmunconference@gmail.com. I’m looking forward to your attendance in February!
                    <br/> <br/> Best regards,
                    <br/> Shriya Chemudupati
                    <br/> Secretary General
                    <br/> VTMUNC II
